Sustainable way forward at Ambuja
Ambuja Cements strives to minimise its negative environmental impacts and create long-term value for all             stakeholders, by integrating sustainability principles into each aspect of the business. Acting sustainably             is not only a business imperative but also provides us with a competitive advantage. Our focus areas include             energy efficiency, waste management and circular economy, water positivity, tree plantation, and ultimately             achieving our net zero goals defined under Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), thereby reducing overall             carbon footprint.
