Notice to Job Seekers
                       It has come to our notice that unscrupulous agencies are alluring job aspirants with claims of offering "employment opportunities with Ambuja Cements Company" and extorting money as "security deposit, documentation processing fees, etc".
                        

                        We would like all job aspirants to be aware that AMBUJA CEMENTS LTD. never requires applicants to pay any amount at any stage of its recruitment and selection process. 
                        

                        If any job aspirant comes across any such unauthorised demand, they can immediately contact our Recruitment Team at our Corporate Office, Mumbai on 022 6616 7000 / 4066 7000.
